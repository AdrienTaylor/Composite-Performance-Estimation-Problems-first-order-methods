Version: December 23, 2015

This version is based on the code 
"Unconstrained-Performance-Estimation-Problems-first-order-methods-",
and relies on the same structures. It allows studying projected and proximal
variants of gradient methods.

The original code for the unconstrained setting is still available.

----- Setup

In order to use the code, the user should have YALMIP installed, along
with some semidefinite solver (e.g. Mosek, Sedumi, SDPT3, ...).

Once YALMIP and the SDP solver installed, the user can put the code in the
directory of his choice and execute the demo file step by step.
